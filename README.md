## Overview
This repository contains several synthetic benchmark datasets for testing
algorithms for predicting the orbits of emission-line binaries. Each dataset 
is formulated with a different noise specification to challenge algorithms to 
make accurate predictions, especially in the presence of systematics.

## Quick start
Clone the repo. Install python3.8 and the module requirements. 
Run example_data_loader.py. Start applying your algorithms.

## Publications
